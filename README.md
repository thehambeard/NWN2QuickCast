# NWN2 QuickCast

## This is an OMM mod, use Modfinder to install!  Unity Mod Manager (UMM) will not work.

Features:
*  Works nearly identical to NWN2 Quick Cast
*  Expandable spell books: click spell book header to show/hide the entire spell book.
*  Scalable window, use top right button to click and drag to scale window to fit your screen.
*  Drag window, use top header where it says quick cast to move window.
*  Resize window, use bottom edge to resize window in Y direction.
*  Settings button in top right (gears) will allow the binding to hide and show window to be set. This will also allow back color to be set.
*  Spontaneous metamagic. Spontaneous casters can now pick meta's on the fly.  The spell list will update automatically. Built spells in the meta builder will still work
*  Conversions can be accessed by two ways.  If they are mandatory, left click will open the conversion window automatically. Optional (object bond, healing, etc..) can be accessed with right click.

Known Issues:
* There are still some layout and visual quirks that need ironed out.
* Need to clear spells when multiple characters selected. (I forgot to include it in alpha)
